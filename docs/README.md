# User Guide

Luke is a CLI-based simple to-do list app for you to keep track of all your tasks, big and small!
If Notion's overwhelming amount of functionality intimidates you, this might just be the to-do
list app for you.

## Quick start

## Features 

Note that text in brackets are arguments you are supposed to replace when entering the command.

### Save different types of tasks

You can save your tasks under one of three types: Todo, Deadline and Event. 
1. Todo

A todo task has only one field: the description of the task.
The simplest format for the simplest tasks.

2. Deadline


A deadline task has two fields: the description of the task, and the deadline.
Suited for tasks with a deadline you need to keep track of.

3. Event

An event task has two fields: the description of the task, start time, and end time.
Suited for events with a start time and end time that you need to keep track of.

The type of task is labeled at the front of the output:

`[T]`: todo task
`[D]`: deadline task
`[E]`: event task

Some examples below:
```
[T][ ] borrow book -> todo task
[D][ ] return book (by: Wednesday) -> deadline task
[E][ ] librarian interview (from: Tues 2pm to: Tues 3pm) -> event task
```

### List all tasks

You can list all tasks using the `list` command.

It will list all tasks you have in order, displaying the following information for todo tasks:
1. Task number
2. Task type
3. Marked/Unmarked
4. Description

For deadline tasks, it will also display:
5. Deadline

For event tasks, it will also display:
5. Start time
6. End time

Example of output:
```
Here are the tasks in your list:
[T][ ] borrow book
[D][ ] return book (by: Wednesday)
[E][ ] librarian interview (from: Tues 2pm to: Tues 3pm)
```


### Mark and unmark tasks

You can mark and unmark tasks using the `mark` and `unmark` commands to keep track of whether
a task has been completed.

Example of marked vs. unmarked tasks:
```
[T][X] borrow book -> marked
[T][ ] borrow book -> unmarked
```

A new task is unmarked by default.

### Delete tasks

You can delete tasks using the `delete` commands to remove tasks from the list.
The deleted task will be displayed.

### Find tasks

You can find tasks using the `find` command to find tasks whose description contain your input.
It does not select tasks whose other fields contain your input - it only checks the description
of each task.

### Edit tasks

You use the `edit` command to edit a field of a task.

### Save tasks to your local drive

You use the `bye` command to save the list to your local drive.

Whenever you open this application, your local list is automatically loaded into the application (if
the save file exists).
